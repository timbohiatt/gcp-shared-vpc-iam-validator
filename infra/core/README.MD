# INFORMATION 

The IaC (Terraform) in this directory is not supposed to be here in production; This folder is only here to show how the GitHub Repository and required Workload Identity Federation configration is created for this workflow automation to work;

If you would like to use this as a demo. That is no problem. But leaving this here would be detrimental as it could allow developers to circumnavigate the GitHub Actions you have developers to handle the validation of access for firewall rule changes;
